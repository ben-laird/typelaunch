# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please make sure to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when contributing.

## Getting Started

Before beginning, read the [README](../README.md) to familiarize yourself with the project. Next, look for any open issues you could contribute to; add the `help-wanted` or `good-first-issue` labels to your search to find issues with contributors looking for help or great issues to make a first contribution to. If there are assignees, contact them and ask to be a part of the contribution team.

To begin contributing, clone the project locally. Next, run `npm install` to install dependencies (and dev dependencies) as well as initialize husky hooks. Afterwards, run `npm run watch:build` and in a separate terminal instance run `npm run watch:test` to build and test the project with watch mode. These commands encourage test-driven development.

## Adding an Issue

If you have a problem that needs to be fixed or would like to suggest some new functionality, you can submit an issue using the template that best represents the issue you have.
Before creating a new issue, check the issues list to see if the issue is already documented; if it is not documented, feel free to create a new issue! Fill out as many sections of the issue form as possible; the more information to work with, the better the fix or new functionality will be.
If you think you know a way to close the issue, follow the steps in the [Getting Started](../typelaunch/typelaunch-contributing.md#getting-started) section to get your development environment going.
