# Contributing to TypeLaunch

Contributions to TypeLaunch are greatly appreciated. Please make sure to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when contributing.

## Getting Started

For starters, read the TypeLaunch [README](../README.md) as well as [`typelaunch.md`](typelaunch.md) to familiarize yourself with the project and how it operates. Please especially pay attention to the [opinions and philosophy section](typelaunch.md#opinions-and-philosophy), as any feature request, bug report, or other issue not in line with the opinions and philosophy of TypeLaunch will most likely be marked with a `wontfix` label and/or closed and locked.

For simplicity, the most important tenets of TypeLaunch are:

- Clutter bad, :x: intuitive structure good :white_check_mark:
- Rigidity bad, :x: easy customization good :white_check_mark:
- Looseness bad, :x: constructive strictness good :white_check_mark:
- Manual bad, :x: automatic help good :white_check_mark:

Look for any issues you could help with. TypeLaunch does not use assignees for issues to allow for anyone to fork and work on whatever suits them.

Next, clone TypeLaunch to your local machine. Run `npm install` at the root of the project to get your packages delivered right to your `node_modules` directory and get husky hooks up and running. If you intend to write any code, run `npm run watch:build` and in a new terminal instance run `npm run watch:test`. Oftentimes just running the latter is okay, since TypeLaunch is just meant to be a template repo and requires no full build.

## Adding an Issue

If you have a problem that needs to be fixed or would like to suggest some new functionality, you can submit an issue using the template that best represents the issue you have.
Before creating a new issue, check the issues list to see if the issue is already documented; if it is not documented, feel free to create a new issue! Fill out as many sections of the issue form as possible; the more information to work with, the better the fix or new functionality will be.
If you think you know a way to close the issue, follow the steps in the [Getting Started](typelaunch-contributing.md#getting-started) section to get your development environment going.
